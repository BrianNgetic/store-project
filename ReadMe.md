This was a store  project I started when self teaching java and wanted to practice inheritance, polymorphism and file io because at the time i used a txt file based db system to keep track 
of my inventory but Once I got comfortable I scrapped that and wanted to implement an actual backend . 
I chose Springboot as my backend framework because of I liked working with java and its wide use in the current market.
i have learnt alot so far through my progression including db relationship, a structur layered artichture, i integrated spring security with authentication flow and 
bCrypt password encoding.As the project grew, i recently I added cart logic, user management, and product hierarchies, which pushed me to think more carefully about 
database design and domain modeling. I’m now planning to continue expanding it by refining order processing, improving security, adding DTO mapping and validation, 
and preparing it for cloud deployment. I’m excited about how much I’ve grown through building this, and I’m looking forward to continuing to strengthen my backend engineering
skills as the project evolves.
